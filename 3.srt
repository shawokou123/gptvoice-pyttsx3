Bill Gates said there is no one in our 
time who has done more to push the 
bounds of science Innovation than you 
well it's kind of to say well that's 
nice thing to have anyone say about you 
nice coming from Bill Gates but oddly 
enough when it comes to AI actually for 
around a decade you've almost been doing 
the opposite and saying hang on we need 
to think about what we're doing and what 
we're pushing here and what do we do to 
make this safe and and actually maybe we 
shouldn't be pushing as faster as hard 
as we are like I mean you've been doing 
it for a decade like what was it that 
caused you to think about it that way 
and you know why do we need to be 
worried yeah I've been somewhat of a 
Cassandra for quite a while where where 
people would I would tell people like we 
should really be concerned about AI they 
be like what are you talking about like 
they've never really had any experience 
with with it but since I was immersed in 
technology I have been immersed in 
technology for a long time I could see 
it coming so but I think this year was 
there have been a number of 
breakthroughs I mean you know the point 
in which someone can see a dynamically 
created video of themselves you know 
like somebody can make a video of you 
saying anything in real time or me and 
so the sort of the the Deep fake videos 
which are really incredibly good in fact 
sometimes more convincing than real ones 
and deep real and and then and then 
obviously things like CH GPT were were 
quite remarkable now I saw gpt1 gpt2 
gpt3 gp4 that you know the holes sort of 
lead up to that so it was easy for me to 
kind of see where it's going if you just 
sort of extrapolate the points on a 
curve and assume that Trend will 
continue then we will have profound 
artificial intelligence and obviously at 
a level that far exceeds human 
intelligence so but I'm glad to see at 
this point that people are taking safety 
seriously and I'd like to say thank you 
for holding this AI safety conference I 
think actually will go down in history 
as being very important I think it's 
really quite profound and and I do think 
overall that the potential is there for 
artificial intelligence AI to have most 
likely a positive effect and to create a 
future of abundance where there is no 
scarcity of goods and services but it is 
somewhat of the the magic Genie problem 
where if you have a magic Genie that can 
grant all the wishes usually those 
stories don't end well be careful what 
you wish for including wishes so you 
talked a little bit about the summit and 
thank you for being engaged in it which 
has been great and people enjoyed having 
you there putting in this dialogue now 
one of the things that we achieved today 
in the meetings between the companies 
and the leaders was an agreement that 
externally ideally governments should be 
doing safety testing of models before 
their release I think this is something 
that you've spoken about a little bit it 
was something we worked really hard on 
because my job in government is to say 
hang on there is a potential risk not a 
definite risk but a potential risk of 
something that could be bad you know my 
job is to protect the country and we can 
only do that if we develop the 
capability we need in our safety 
Institute and then go in and make sure 
we can test the models before they are 
released Delight of that happen today 
but you know what's your view on what we 
should be doing right you've talked 
about the potential risk right again we 
don't know but you know what are the 
types of things governments like our 
should be doing to manage and mitigate 
against those risks well generally think 
that it is good for government to play a 
role when the public safety is is at 
risk so you know really for the vast 
majority of software the public safety 
is not at risk if the uh app crashes on 
your phone or your laptop it's not a 
massive catastrophe but when you're 
talking about digital superintelligence 
I think which does pose a risk to the 
public then there is a role for 
government to play to safeguard the 
interest of the public and and this is 
of course true in in many fields you 
know Aviation cars you know I deal with 
regular 
throughout the world because of stalling 
being Communications Rockets being 
Aerospace and cars you know being 
vehicle transport so I'm very familiar 
with dealing with with regulators and I 
actually agree with the vast majority of 
regulations there's a few that I 
disagree with from time to time but 0.1% 
probably of well less than 1% of 
regulations I disagree with so there is 
some concern from people in silic Valley 
who who' have never dealt with 
Regulators before and they think that 
this is going to just Crush Innovation 
and and slow them down and be annoying 
but and it will be annoying it's true 
they're not wrong about that but but I 
think there's we've learned over the 
years that having a referee is a good 
thing and if you look at any sports game 
there's always a referee and nobody's 
suggesting I think to have a sports game 
without one and I think that's the right 
way to think about this is for for 
government to be a referee to make sure 
the sportsmanlike conduct and that the 
public safety is you know is is 
addressed that we care about the public 
safety because I think there might be at 
times too much optimism about technology 
and I speak I say that as a technologist 
I mean so I ought to know and and like I 
said on on balance I think that the AI 
will be a force for good most likely but 
the probability of it going bad is not 
0% yeah so we just need to mitigate the 
downside potential and then how you talk 
about referee and that's what which de 
right there yeah well there we go I mean 
you know and we talked about this and 
Demus and I discussed this a long time 
ago like literally facing right at and 
actually you know Demis to his credit 
and the credit of people in the industry 
did say that to us I think you say it's 
not right that Demus and his colleagues 
are marking their own homework right 
there needs to be someone independent 
and that's why we've developed the 
safety Institute here I mean do you 
think governments can develop the 
expertise one of the things we need to 
do is say hang on you know Demis Sam all 
the others have got a lot of very smart 
people doing this governments need to 
quickly tool up capability wise 
Personnel wise which is what we're doing 
I mean do you think it is possible for 
governments to do that fast enough given 
how quickly the technology is developing 
or what do we need to do to make sure we 
do it quick enough no I think it's a 
great Point you're making the pace of AI 
is faster than any technology I've seen 
in history by far and it's it seems to 
be growing in capability by at at least 
fivefold perhaps 10-fold per year it'll 
certainly grow by an order of magnitude 
next year yeah so so and and government 
isn't used to moving at that speed but I 
think even if there are not firm 
regulations even if there's not even if 
there isn't an enforcement capability 
Simply Having insight and being able to 
highlight concerns to the public will be 
very powerful so even if that's all 
that's accomplished I think that will be 
very good okay yeah well hopefully we 
can do better than that hopefully yeah 
yeah no but that that's help we were 
talking before it was striking you know 
you're someone who spent their life in 
technology living Mo's law and what was 
interesting over the last couple of days 
talking to everyone who's doing the 
development of this and I think You' 
concur with this is just the pace of 
advancement here is unlike anything all 
of you have seen in your careers in 
technology is that fair because you've 
got these kind of compounding effects 
from the hardware and the data and the 
Personnel yeah I mean the two currently 
the two leading centers for AI 
development are the San Francisco Bay 
area and the sort of London area and 
there are many other places where it's 
being done but those are the two leading 
areas so I think if you know if the 
United States and the UK and China are 
sort of aligned on on safety that's all 
going to be thing because that's really 
that's where that's where the leadership 
is generally you actually interesting 
you mentioned China that so I I took a 
decision to invite China to to Summit 
over the last couple days and it was not 
an easy decision a lot of people 
criticize me for it you know my view is 
if you're going to try serious 
conversation you need to but what would 
your thoughts you do business all around 
the world you just talked about it there 
yeah you know should we be engaging with 
them can we trust them is that the right 
thing to have done if if we don't if 
China is not on board with AI safety it 
it's somewhat of a mood situation the 
single biggest objection that I get to 
any kind of AI regulation or or sort of 
safety controls are well China is not 
going to do it and therefore they will 
just jump into the lead and exceed us 
all but actually China is willing to 
participate in safety and thank you for 
inviting them and I and they you know I 
I think we should thank China for for 
attending when I was in China earlier 
this year the my main subject of 
discussion with this the leadership in 
China was AI safety and saying that this 
is really something that they should 
care about and they took it seriously 
and and and you are too which is great 
and having them here I think was 
essential really if they're not 
participants it's pointless it's 
pointless yeah no that and I think we 
were pleased I they were engaged 
yesterday in the discussions and 
actually ended up signing the same 
community okay that everyone else did 
which is a good stop right and I said if 
we need everyone to approach us in a 
similar way if we're going to have I 
think a realistic chance of of resolving 
it I was going to you talked about 
Innovation earlier and regulation being 
annoying there was a good debate today 
we had about open source and I think you 
you've kind of been a proponent of 
algorithmic transparency and making some 
of the X algorithms public and you 
actually we were talking about Jeffrey 
Hinton on the way in he he's 
particularly been very concerned about 
open- Source models being used by bad 
factors you've got a group of people who 
say they are critical to Innovation 
happening in that distributed way look 
it's a trick there's probably no perfect 
answer and there's a tricky balance what 
are your thoughts on how we should 
approach this open- Source question or 
you know where should we be targeting 
whatever regulatory or monitoring that 
we're going to do well the open source 
algorithms and data tend to lag the 
closed Source by 6 to 12 but so that but 
given the rate of improvement that 
there's actually therefore quite a big 
difference between the the closed source 
and the open if things are improving by 
a factor of let's say five or more than 
being a year behind is you're five times 
worse so it's a pretty big difference 
and that might be actually an okay 
situation but it certainly will get to 
the point where you've got open source 
AI that can do that that will start to 
approach human level intelligence will 
perap succeeded I don't don't know quite 
what to do about it I think it's 
somewhat inable that there will be some 
amount of Open Source and I guess I 
would have a slight bias towards open 
source because at least you can see 
what's going on whereas closed Source 
you don't know what's going on now it 
should be said with AI that even if it's 
open source 
do you actually know what's going on 
because if you've got a gigantic data 
file and you know sort of billions of of 
weights and parameters you can't just 
read it and see what it's going to do 
it's a gigantic file of inscrutable 
numbers you can test it when you run it 
you can test it you can run a bunch of 
tests to see what it's going to do but 
it's probabilistic as opposed to 
deterministic it's not like traditional 
programming where you've got a you've 
got very discret logic and the outcome 
is very predictable and you can read 
each line and see what each Line's going 
to do a neural net is just a whole bunch 
of probabilities I mean it sort of ends 
up being a giant comma separated value 
file it's like our digital gu is a CSP 
file really okay that is kind of what it 
is yeah now that point you've just made 
is one that we have been talking about a 
lot because again conversation with the 
people are developing their technology 
make the point that you've just made it 
is not like normal software where 
there's predictability about inputs 
improving leading to this particular 
output improving and as the models 
iterate and improve we don't quite know 
what's going to come out the other end I 
think agree with that which is why I 
think there is this bias for look we 
need to get in there while the training 
runs are being done before the models 
are released to understand what is this 
new iteration brought about in terms of 
capability which it sounds like you 
would would agree with I I was going to 
shift gears a little bit on you know 
you've talked a lot about human 
consciousness human agency which 
actually might strike people as strange 
given that you are known for being such 
a brilliant innovator and technologist 
but it's quite heartfelt when I hear you 
talk about it and the importance of 
maintaining that agency in technology 
and preserving human consciousness now 
it kind of links to the thing I was 
going to ask is when I do interviews or 
talk to people out and about in this job 
about AI the thing that comes up most 
actually is is probably not so much of 
the stuff we've been talking about but 
jobs it's what does AI mean for my job 
is it going to mean that I don't have a 
job or my kids are not going to have a 
job now answer as a as a policy maker as 
a leader is actually AI is already 
creating jobs and you can see that in 
the companies that are starting also the 
way it's being used is little bit more 
as a co-pilot necessarily versus 
replacing the person there's still human 
agency but it's helping you do your job 
better which is a good thing and and as 
we've seen with technological 
Revolutions in the past clearly there's 
change in the labor market the amount of 
jobs quoting an MIT study today that 
they did a couple of years ago something 
like 60% of the jobs at that moment 
didn't exist 40 years ago so hard to 
predict and my job is to create an 
incredible education system whether it's 
at school whether it's retraining people 
at any point in their career because 
ultimately if we've got a skilled 
population they'll be able to keep up 
with the the pace of change and have a 
good life but you know that it's still a 
concern and you know you what would your 
kind of observation be on on AI and the 
impact on labor markets and people's 
jobs and how they should feel about that 
as they they think about this well I 
think we are seeing the most disruptive 
force in history here you know where we 
have for the first time we will have for 
the first time something that is smarter 
than the smartest human and that I mean 
it's hard to say exactly what that 
moment is but there will come a point 
where no job is needed you can have a 
job if you want to have a job for sort 
of personal satisfaction but the AI will 
be able to do everything so I don't know 
if that makes people comfortable 
uncomfortable it's you know that's why I 
say if you if you wish for a magic Genie 
that gives you any wishes you want and 
there's no limit you don't have those 
three limit three wish limit nonsense 
you just have as many wishes as you want 
so it it's both good and bad one of the 
challenges in the future will be how do 
we find meaning in life if if you have a 
magic Genie that can do everything you 
want I I do think we it's it's it's hard 
you know when when when there's new 
technology it tends to have usually 
follow an S curve in this case we're 
going to be on the exponential portion 
of the S curve for a long time and you 
we have to ask for anything it it won't 
be we won't have Universal basic income 
we'll have Universal High income so in 
some in some sense it'll be somewhat of 
a leveler or an equalizer because really 
I think everyone will have access to 
this magic Genie and you'll able to ask 
any question it'll be certainly be good 
for Education it'll be the best tutor 
you could and the most patient tutor sit 
there all day and will be no shortage of 
goods and services there will be an age 
of abundance I think if I'd recommend 
people read in Banks the the banks 
culture books are probably the best 
envisioning in fact not probably they're 
definitely by far the best envisioning 
of an AI future there's nothing even 
close so I'd recommend really recommend 
Banks I'm very big fan all his books are 
good doesn't say which one all of them 
so so that's that that'll give you a 
sense of what is a I guess a fairly 
utopian protop future with with AI yeah 
which is good from a as you said it's a 
Universal High income which is a nice 
phrase and that's it's good from a kind 
materialistic sense a of abundance 
actually that it kind of then leads to 
the question that you pose right I'm 
someone who believes you know work gives 
you meaning right I talk a lot about 
that as you know I think work is a good 
thing it you know gives people purpose 
in their lives and if you then remove a 
large chunk of that you know what does 
that mean and where do you get that you 
know where do you get that drive that 
motivation that purpose I mean you 
talking about it you you work a lot of 
hours you know no as I was mentioning 
when we were talking earlier I have to 
somewhat engage in delibera supension of 
disbelief because I'm putting so much 
Blood Sweat and Tears into a work 
project and burning the you know 3:00 
a.m. oil then I'm like wait why am I 
doing this I can just wait for the AI to 
do it I'm just lashing myself for no 
reason yeah must be a glutton for 
punishment something call Demus and tell 
him to hurry up and then you can have a 
holiday right that's the plan yeah no 
it's a it's a tricky it's a tricky thing 
because I think you know part of our job 
is to make sure that we can navigate to 
that very I think largely positive place 
and help people through it between now 
and then because these things bring a 
lot of about a change in the labor 
market as we've seen yeah I I think it's 
probably is generally a good thing cuz 
you know there are a lot of jobs that 
are uncomfortable or dangerous or sort 
of tedious and the computer will have no 
problem doing that be happy to do that 
all day long so you know it's fun to 
cook food but it's not that fun to wash 
the dishes like but the computer's 
perfectly happy to wash the dishes and I 
I I guess there is you know we still 
have a sports like where where humans 
compete and like the Olympics and 
obviously a machine can can go faster 
than any human but we still have we 
still humans race against each other and 
and have all you know have these Sports 
competitions against each other where 
even though the machines are better 
they're still I guess competing to see 
who can be the best human at something 
and and people do find fulfillment in 
that so I guess that's perhaps a good 
example of how even when machines are 
faster than us stronger than us we still 
find a way we still enjoy competing 
against other humans to at least who the 
best human that's a good that's a good 
analogy and we've been talking a lot 
about managing the risks I just before 
we move on and finish on AI is just talk 
a little bit about the opportunities you 
know you you're engaging in lots of 
different companies you're being an 
obvious one which is doing some exciting 
stuff you touched on the thing that I'm 
probably most excited about which is an 
education yeah and I think many people 
would have seen Sal's video from earlier 
this year is Ted talk about as you 
talked about it's like personal tutor 
yeah personal tutor an amazing personal 
tutor an amazing personal tutor and we 
know the difference in learning having 
that personalized tutor is incredible 
compared to classroom learning if you 
can have every child have a personal 
tutor specifically for them that then 
just evolves with them over time 
extraordinary so that you know for me I 
look at that I think gosh that is within 
reach at this point and that's one of 
the benefits I'm most excited about that 
when you look at the the landscape of 
things that you see as possible what is 
it that you know you are particularly 
excited about I I think certainly AI 
tuts are going to be amazing perhaps 
already are I think there's also perhaps 
companionship which may seem odd cuz how 
can the computer really be your friend 
but if you have an that has memory you 
know and remembers all of your 
interactions and has read every you're 
going say like give it permission to 
read everything you've ever done so it 
really will know you better than anyone 
perhaps even yourself and where you can 
talk to it every day and those 
conversations spold upon each other you 
will actually have a great friend so 
long as that friend can stay your friend 
and not get turned off or something 
don't turn off my friends but I think 
that will actually be a real thing and I 
have a one of my sons is sort of has 
some learning disabilities has troubl 
making friends actually and I was like 
well you know he an AI friend would 
actually be great for him oh okay you 
know that was a surprise answer that's 
actually worth worth reflecting on 
that's really interesting Ian we're 
already seeing it actually as we deliver 
you know Psychotherapy anyway now doing 
far more by digitally and by telephone 
to people and it's making a huge 
difference and you can see a world in 
which actually you know AI can provide 
that social benefit to people um just 
quick question on X and then we should 
open it up to everybody you made a 
change when you in one of the well made 
many changes but one of one of the one 
of the changes love that letter got a 
real thing about it you you really do 
you really do one of the change which 
you know kind of you know goes into the 
space that you know we have to operate 
in and this balance between free speech 
and moderation it's you know we grapple 
with as politicians you were grappling 
with your own version of that and you 
moved away from a kind of manual human 
way of doing it the moderation to the 
community note and and I think that's it 
was it was an interesting change right 
it's not what everyone else has done it 
would be good you know what's what was 
the reasoning behind that and why do you 
think that is a better way to do that 
yeah part of the problem is if you if 
you Empower people as censors then well 
how there's going to be some amount of 
bias that they have and then whoever 
appoints the sensors is effectively in 
control of information so then the idea 
behind Community notes is well how do we 
have a consensus driven I mean it's not 
really censoring but consensus driven 
approach to truth how do we or how do we 
make things the least amount untrue you 
can say like one can't pass perhaps get 
to Pure truth but you can aspire to be 
more truthful so the thing about 
Community notes is doesn't actually 
delete anything it simply adds context 
now that context could be this thing is 
untrue for the following reasons and but 
but importantly with Community notes 
everything is open source actually so 
you can see the the software every line 
of the software you can see all of the 
data that went into a community node and 
you can independently create that 
Community note so if you've got if you 
see manipulation of the data you can 
actually highlight that and say well 
this this appears to be some gaming of 
the system and you can suggest 
improvements so it's maximum 
transparency yeah which is I think 
combined with the kind of wisdom of the 
crowds and trying to get to a better 
answer as and really one of the key 
elements of community notes is that in 
order for a note to be shown people who 
have historically disagreed must agree 
and there is a bit of AI usage here so 
there's populated parameter space around 
each contributor to the community notes 
and then a parameter space so so 
everyone's got basically these vectors 
associated with them which so it's it's 
not as simple as as right or left it's 
saying it's more it's several hundred 
vectors that that because things are 
more complicated than something right 
right or left and and then we'll we'll 
do sort of inverse correlation say like 
okay these people generally disagree but 
they agree about this note okay so then 
that so then that that that gives the 
note credibility okay yeah that's that's 
the core of it and it's working quite 
well yeah I've yet to see a note 
actually be present for more than a few 
hours that that is incorrect so the 
batting average is extremely good and 
when I ask you people say oh they're 
worried about Community notes sort of 
being disinformation like send me one 
and then they can't so so I think it's I 
think it's quite good I mean the general 
aspiration is with with the xplatform is 
to inform and entertain the public and 
to be as accurate as possible and as 
truthful as possible even if someone 
doesn't like the truth you know people 
don't always like the truth no not 
always but that's the aspiration and I 
think if if we are if we stay true to 
the truth then I think we'll find that 
people use use the system to learn what 
is going on and to I think actually 
truth pays so I think it'll be what I 
mean assuming you don't want to engage 
in self delusion then I think it's it's 
the smart move excellent very helpful 
right let's open it up to all our guests 
here we've got some microphones they cou 
find you we got yes go for it thank you 
good evening uh Alice bentin from 
entrepreneur first uh thank you for a 
fascinating conversation I suppose a 
question for each of you prime minister 
the UK has some of the best universities 
in the world we have the talent what 
will it take for the UK to be a real 
breeding unicorn companies um being a 
Founder in the UK is still a non-obvious 
career choice for the most exceptional 
technical Talent what are the cultural 
elements that we need to put into place 
to change this thank you you want to go 
first go for it sure well you're right 
that there are um cultural elements 
where you know the the culture should 
celebrate creating new companies and and 
there should be a bias towards 
supporting small companies cu the ones 
that need nurturing the larger companies 
really don't need nurturing so you know 
just you can think of it's sort of like 
a garden if it's a little Sprout it 
needs needs nurturing if it's a Mighty 
Oak it doesn't need quite as much so I 
think that that is a mindset change that 
is important but I should mention that 
London is you know London and San 
Francisco or the Bay Area are really the 
two centers for AI so that so London is 
actually doing very well on that front 
the two Mo I say the two leading 
locations on Earth you know San 
Francisco is probably ahead of London 
but London's really very strong well 
London area greater London home counties 
I guess so I'm just saying objectively 
this is the case and but you do need 
that you need the infrastructure you 
need landlords who are willing to rent 
to new companies you need law firms and 
accountants that are willing to support 
companies and it's generally a mind it 
is a mindset change and I think some of 
that is happening but I think really 
it's just culturally people need to 
decide this is a good thing yeah yeah no 
actually well thanks for what you said 
about the UK it's something that we work 
hard on lots of people in the room are 
part of what makes this a fabulous place 
for intive companies Including Alice so 
Alice what I'd say is my job is to get 
all the you know the nuts and bolts 
right make sure that all of you starting 
companies can raise the capital that you 
need everything from you know your seed 
funding with our incredible you know e 
tax reliefs all the way through to you 
know your late stage rounds and we need 
reform of our Pension funds and the 
Chancellor's got a bunch of incredible 
reforms to unlock capital from all the 
people who have it and deploy it into 
growth Equity right that is a work in 
progress we're not there yet but I think 
we're we're making good progress we need 
talent we need people right so that 
means an education system that 
prioritizes the things that matter and 
you've seen my reforms I go on about 
more maths more maths more maths but I 
think that that's important but also 
attracting the best and the brightest 
here if you look at our fastest growing 
companies in in this country and I think 
it's probably the same in in the US over 
half of them have a non-british Founder 
right and so that tells you we've got to 
be a place that is open to the world's 
best and brightest entrepreneurial 
Talent so the Visa regime that we've put 
in place I think does that makes it easy 
for those people to come here and then 
actually it's the thing that we spent 
the beginning of the session talking 
about the regulation right making sure 
that we've got a regulatory system 
that's Pro Innovation that yeah we of 
course we always need guard rails on the 
things that will worry us but we've got 
to create a space for people to innovate 
and do different things you know those 
are all my jobs the thing that is 
tougher is the thing that Elon talked 
about which is culture right it's how do 
you transpose that culture from places 
like Silicon Valley across the world 
where people are unafraid to give up the 
security of a regular paycheck to go and 
start something and be comfortable with 
failure you you talk about that a lot I 
think you talked about it more in when 
you were playing games right but that 
you've got to be comfortable failing and 
knowing that's just part of the process 
and that is a it's a tricky cultural 
thing to do overnight but it's an 
important part of I think creating that 
kind of environment yeah if if if you 
don't succeed with your first startup it 
shouldn't be sort of a catastrophic 
career ending exactly thing it should be 
you know well good I think gener should 
like should be like well you know you 
gave it a good shot you know and now try 
again exactly and it's so one thing I 
was going to mention is like obviously 
creating a company is sort of a highrisk 
high reward situation but I don't know 
quite what the how it work works in the 
UK I think it's probably better than 
Continental Europe but I'm not sure how 
it is in the UK but but if somebody's 
basically going to risk their life 
savings and with and the vast majority 
of startups fail so I mean you hear 
about the startups that succeed but most 
companies are most startups consist of 
you know a massive amount of work 
followed by failure that's actually most 
companies and so it's a highrisk high 
reward and so the higher reward part 
does need to be there for to make sense 
I think that was a very soft pitch for 
tax policy that I mean 
but I actually I can tell you so look I 
AI agree and we have so we have I think 
relative to certainly European countries 
but certainly the US definitely 
California a much lower rate of capital 
gains tax right so for those people who 
are risking and growing something like 
we think the reward should be there at 
the end so 20% capital gains tax rate 
and on stock options I don't know if 
we've got anyone from index ventures in 
the room so you know index one of our 
bleeding VC funds here they do a regular 
report looking at most countries tax 
treatment of stock options and you know 
when I was Chancellor of you know 
treasury secretary equivalent you know 
we were I think down at we were pretty 
good but we were fourth or fifth and I 
said we need to for exactly the reason 
that you mentioned I was like this has 
got to be the best place for innovators 
we need to move that up and I think in 
the last iteration of that report we had 
because of the changes that Jeremy and I 
had made we have moved up to I think 
second from memory so hopefully that 
should give you and everyone else some 
comfort that we recognize that's 
important cuz when people work hard and 
risk things yeah they should be enjoy 
the rewards of that high risk High 
reward yeah and I think we have a we 
very much have a tax system that 
supports that and those are the values 
that you know I believe in and I think 
most of us in this room probably do as 
well right next next question I've got 
seven in front of me and then I'll come 
over here go on thanks very much we've 
talked about some really big Ideas 
Global changing ideas I'm really 
interested particularly in the context 
of creation of Science and Technology 
superhubs and so on how does that map 
onto the everyday lives of of people 
living in say Austin Texas to choose 
around more my case Nottingham East 
Midlands what is how do you see that 
evolving for people you know every day 
the sort of everyday effects of AI for 
context Elon so Seb runs are equivalent 
of CVS right or Walgreens so you know 
when actually I visited right so he's 
got millions of people coming in his 
shops every day and it's making sure how 
do we make this relevant I think s is 
your question how how is this relevant 
to that person you know maybe actually 
let me go I'll go first on that cuz I I 
think it's air point I was just going 
over with the team a couple of things 
that we're doing cuz I was saying like 
how are we doing AI right now that it's 
making a difference to people's lives 
and we have this thing called gov. which 
is which actually when we when it 
happened several years ago was a 
pioneering thing all the government 
information together on one website and 
so you need to get a driving license 
passport any interaction with government 
it was centralized in a very easy 
relatively easy to use way better than 
most so so we're about to deploy AI 
across that platform so that is 
something that I think you know several 
million people a day use right so a 
large chunk of the population is 
interacting with gov.uk every single day 
to do all these day-to-day tasks right 
every one of your customers is doing all 
those things and so we're about to 
deploy AI into that to make that whole 
process so much easier because you know 
some people will be like look well I'm 
currently here and I've lost my passport 
and my flight's in 5 hours at the moment 
that would require you know how many 
steps to figure out what you do you know 
actually when we deploy the AI it should 
be that you could just literally say 
that and boom this is what we're going 
to do walk you through it and that's 
going to benefit millions and millions 
of people every single day right because 
that's a very practical way in my seat 
that I can start using this technology 
to help people in their day-to-day lives 
not just Healthcare discoveries and 
everything else that we're also doing 
but I thought that's quite a powerful 
demonstration of literally your 
day-to-day customer seeing actually 
their just day-to-day life get a little 
bit easier because of something that you 
know Elon Demis and others in this room 
have helped create yeah no exactly the 
the the most immediate thing is just 
being able to ask like having a very 
smart friend friend that you can ask 
anything you know ask how to make 
something how to solve any problem and 
it'll tell you so and obviously 
companies are going to adopt this so I 
think you'll have much better customer 
service I guess essentially that'll 
probably be the first thing you notice 
and and then we talked about education 
yeah so having a tutor so if you're 
trying to understand a subject like 
having a phenomenal tutor on any subject 
that that's really pretty much there 
already almost I mean we need to 
obviously a needs to stop hallucinating 
before you know it can't give you I mean 
we we still have a little bit of the 
problem where it can give you an answer 
that's confidently wrong with great 
grammar you know bullet points and 
everything and citations that was not 
real so it has to be okay we need to 
make sure it's not it's not it's not 
giving you confidently wrong tutor 
answers but but we that's going to 
happen quick pretty quickly where it is 
actually correct so yeah going to say 
for any parent who was homeschooling and 
realizing what their kids needed to be 
helped with that will come as an 
enormous relief I think they very good 
right have we got let's go questions 
over here who have we got we only 
microphones or Brent are you there 
perfect Hi Brent hobman so you know 
you've spoken eloquently about abundance 
and the age of abundance so it feels 
obviously with AI it's everything 
everywhere all at once but with with 
robots and to get the age of abundance 
we'll need a lot of robots I know you're 
working a hard on robots as well are 
there sort of constraints that we should 
think of and our politicians should be 
thinking of that we might get one 
country might get heavily behind in in 
robots they can do all these things and 
enter the age of abundance and therefore 
be at a strategic disadvantage well 
really anything that can be actuated by 
a computer is effectively a robot so you 
can think of frankly Tesla cars are 
robots on Wheels anything that's 
connected to the internet is effectively 
an endpoint actuator for artificial 
intelligence so you've got Boston 
Dynamics obviously they've been making 
impressive robots for a while I think 
they're at this point mostly owned by 
Hyundai so I guess Hyundai is probably 
going to make robots of that are 
humanoid and and and some rather 
interesting shapes that I wasn't 
dissipating like the one that looks like 
a has wheels and looks sort of like a 
kangaroo on Wheels I'm not sure what 
that is but looks a little Ed frankly 
but but there's going to be all sorts of 
robots you've got the company Dyson in 
which I think there some pretty 
impressive things and I think the UK 
will not be behind actually on on that 
front UK also has arm which is really 
the best one one of the best perhaps the 
best in chip design in the world Tesla 
uses a lot of arm technology almost 
everyone does actually so I think the UK 
is in a strong position Germany 
obviously makes a lot of robots 
industrial robots I mean I think 
generally countries that make robots of 
any kind 
even if they seem somewhat conventional 
will be fine I do think there is a a 
safety 
concern especially with humanoid robots 
because um you at least the car can't 
chase you into this building not very 
easily you know or chase you off a tree 
or you know you can sort of run up a 
flight of stairs and get away from a 
Tesla I think there a Stephen King movie 
about that if your car gets possessed so 
but if you have a humanoid robot it can 
basically chase you anywhere so I I 
think we should have some kind of 
hardwired local cut off that you can't 
update from the internet so anything 
that can be software updated from the 
internet obviously can be overridden but 
if you have a local sort of off switch 
where you have to say a key word or 
something and then that puts the robot 
into a safe State it's some kind of 
localized safe State ability an off 
switch you know where you don't have to 
get too close to the robot I don't know 
we've got millions of these things going 
all over the place you're not selling it 
just you know like no I I know I'm 
saying it's is something we should be 
quite concerned about because the Rob 
can follow you anywhere then you know 
what if they just one day get a software 
update and they're not so friendly 
anymore we've got a James Cameron movie 
on our head it's actually that's it's 
funny you're saying that because we in 
our session that we had today I you know 
just would say who they made exactly the 
same point right de so we're talking 
about they're talking about movies 
actually without mentioning James 
Cameron they're talking about James 
Cameron movies but they're saying if you 
think about it it's not just those 
movies but any of these movies trains 
Subways metros they said all these 
movies with the same plot fundamentally 
all end with the person turning it off 
right or finding a way to shut the thing 
down and they were making the same point 
that you were about the importance of 
actual physical off switches and Al the 
technology is great but fately this same 
movie has played out 50 times we've all 
watched it and all fundamentally you 
know you know point I'm referring to 
right it all ends in pretty much the 
same way with someone finding a way to 
just yeah do the thing which is kind of 
interesting that you said the similar 
point right it's prob not the it's not 
the obvious place you'd go to but maybe 
that could be one of the tests for the 
AI we just say like blank is your 
favorite James Cameron movie fill in the 
blank yeah excellent right yes we got 
over there yeah perfect hi uh question 
for you both so I'm a founder of a Ai 
and ml scaleup in the third Center for 
AI which is leads in the north of 
England I'm bit biased since the launch 
of chat GPT three months after that we 
saw a real increase in fishing attacks 
using much more sophisticated language 
patterns what do we do to protect 
businesses consumers so they trust this 
technology better and how do we bring 
them along that Journey with us well I 
think we shouldn't trust it that much 
actually it it is actually quite quite a 
significant challenge because we're 
getting to the point where even open 
source AI can pass uh human capture 
tests so you know this are you a human 
identify all the traffic lights in this 
picture you're like okay yeah is going 
to have a no problem doing that in fact 
it'll do it better than a human and 
faster than a human so we're like how do 
you know at the point which is a better 
human better passing human tests than 
humans then well what tests actually 
make sense that is a real problem I 
don't actually have a good solution to 
it that one of the things we're trying 
to figure out on the xplatform is how to 
deal with that because it really we 
really are at the point where even with 
open source you know readily available 
AI you don't need to be sort of leading 
the field you can actually be better 
than humans at passing these tests and 
that's sort of why we're thinking well 
perhaps we should sort of charge a 
dollar or a pound a year it's a very 
tiny amount of money but it's it still 
makes it prohibitively expensive to make 
a million bots so and especially if you 
need a million payment methods then you 
run out of sort of stolen credit cards 
pretty quickly so that that's that's 
sort of where we're thinking like we 
might have to sort of just charge some 
very tin amount of money3 cents a day 
effectively to deal with the onslaught 
of AI powered bonds and if and that that 
is still a growing problem but it will 
be I think perhaps an insurmountable 
problem next year so and then you have 
to worry about well manipulation of 
information is making something seem 
very popular when in fact it is not 
because it's getting boosted by all 
these likes and reposts from AI powered 
bots so that's why I sort of think 
somewhat inevitably it leads to some 
small payment in order to dramatic 
increased cost of a bot so frankly I 
think probably any social media system 
that doesn't do that will simply be 
overrun by B you know I think my general 
answer would be you know we we need to 
show that we are on top of mitigating 
the risks right so people can trust the 
technology that's what actually the last 
couple of days has been about on the 
safety Summit is just showing you know 
we're investing in the safety Institute 
having the people who can do the 
research on these things to figure out 
how we mitigate against them and we have 
to do it fast and we have to keep iter 
ating it because I all of us probably in 
this room believe that the technology 
can be incredibly powerful but we've got 
to make sure we bring people along that 
Journey with us that we're handling the 
risks that are there and I said there's 
a job to do and the last couple of days 
I think we made good progress on it 
because we want to focus on the 
positives and manage these things but 
that requires action and and that's what 
the last couple of days has been about 
your story your analogy there was part 
of the research that actually you know 
the team working on the task force here 
published presented yesterday I don't 
know if you saw it was which is a 
essentially that it was using AI to do 
to create a ton of fake profiles on 
social media and then infiltrate 
particular groups with particular 
information and actually at the moment 
that is a set to your point it's like 
cost free it's it's getting to the point 
where it's like really you can have a 
100 for a penny sort of thing ridiculous 
and if you think about some of these 
social networks at quite a neighborhood 
or town level there's not that many fake 
profiles quickly suddenly they're 
everywhere and there's some local issue 
that might be of importance and you know 
the team have have run versions of how 
that would look like and suddenly 
they're interacting with everybody and 
then spreading misinformation 
around we literally as part of the 
research that we published on 
misinformation yesterday it's a real 
challenge yeah exactly to your point I 
mean the images it's it's you don't even 
need to steal somebody's uh picture 
because then that's traceable but you 
can actually just say create a new image 
of a person realistic looking but 
doesn't exist and and then create a 
biography realistic but exist and do 
that on mass and practically the only 
way you'll be able to tell us that the 
grammar is too good did giveaway no tyos 
come on now I'm getting wave that 
because I think we are out of time I 
know we take one very brief last 
question and let's make a good one yes 
sir go on you're right in front of me go 
on question for you related to the 
xplatform are there simple things we can 
do especially when it comes to visual 
media you alluded to the fact that it's 
fairly straightforward and effectively 
free to make people like yourself say 
and do things that you never said or did 
can we do something like 
cryptographically sign media I'm from 
Adobe we're working on this project 
Twitter was a member love to see X come 
back digitally sign media to indicate 
not only what was created by AI but what 
came from a camera what was real to 
imbue a sense of Trust in Media that can 
go viral that sounds like a good idea 
actually so if some way of 
authenticating would be good so yeah 
that sounds like a good idea we should 
probably do it there you go and actually 
on that on that point at already it's so 
this is particularly pertinent for 
people in my job right and I've already 
had a situation happen to me with a 
doctored image that goes everywhere 
negative by the time everyone realizes 
well that's fake and we should stop 
sending it the damage is damage and 
actually we would again reflecting today 
if you think next year you've got 
elections in you know I think you know 
the US India I think Indonesia probably 
here there you go massive news and 
actually you've got just an enormous 
junk of the world's population is voting 
next year right and you got EU elections 
as well and you know actually just these 
issues are right in front of us you know 
next next year is where big elections 
across the globe probably the first set 
of Elections where this has been a real 
issue so figuring out how we manag that 
is I think kind of mission critical for 
people who want you know the Integrity 
of our democracy yeah I mean some of it 
is is quite Ting like the pope and the 
puffer jacket have you seen that one 
that's amazing but I mean I still run 
into people who who who think that's 
real I'm like well what are the odds 
he's wearing a puffer jacket in July and 
you know be sweating but it actually 
looked quite quite dashing I say in fact 
I think AI fashion is going to be a real 
things so so I Doom and Gloom like we 
live in the most interesting times and I 
think this is it is you know like 80% 
likely to be good and 20% bad and I 
think we're if we're cognizant and and 
careful about the bad part on balance 
actually it will be the future that we 
want or the the future that is 
preferable and it actually will be 
somewhat of a leveler an equalizer in 
the sense that you know I think everyone 
will have access to goods and services 
and education and so you know I think 
probably it leads to more human 
happiness so I guess I'd probably leave 
on an optimistic note perfect yeah well 
that's a that is a great note to end on 
I think that you know we all want that 
that better future we think it's there 
the promise of it is certainly there 
lots of people in this room including 
yourselves are working hard to make it 
happen our job in government is to make 
sure it happens safely but on the basis 
of this conversation in the last couple 
of days I'm certainly leaving more 
confident that we can make that happen 
so it's been a huge privilege and 
pleasure to have you here thank you very 
much for having me
