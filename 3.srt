hello 
so 
in just a few minutes um elon musk will 
be joining us here live on stage 
for a conversation uh 
rumor has it there are a few things to 
talk about with him 
um 
we we we will see 
but um before that 
i just want to show you something 
special 
i want you to come with me to 
tesla's huge gigafactory in austin texas 
so the day before it opened last week 
the evening before i was allowed to walk 
around it 
no one else there 
and what i saw there was honestly pretty 
mind-blowing 
this is elon musk's famous machine that 
builds the machine and his view the 
secret to a sustainable future is not 
just making an electric car 
it's making a system that churns out 
huge numbers of electric cars with a 
margin so that they can fund further 
growth 
when i was there um none of us knew 
whether elon would actually be able to 
make it here today so i took the chance 
to sit down with him and record an epic 
interview 
and i just want to show you 
a nine 
an eight minute excerpt of that 
interview so here from austin texas elon 
musk 
i want us to switch now to think a bit 
about artificial intelligence i i'm 
curious about your timelines and how you 
predict and how come some things are so 
amazingly on the money and some aren't 
so when it comes to predicting 
sales of tesla vehicles for example 
i mean you've kind of been amazing i 
think in 2014 
when tesla had sold that year 60 000 
cars you said 2020 i think we will do 
half a million a year yeah we did almost 
exactly half a million five years ago 
last time you came today we um i asked 
you about for self-driving and um you 
said yep this very year where i am 
confident that we will have a car going 
from la to new york uh without any 
intervention yeah i i don't want to blow 
your mind but i'm not always right 
um 
so talk what's the difference between 
those two why why 
why has full self-driving in particular 
been so hard to predict i mean the thing 
that really got me and i think it's 
going to get a lot of other people is 
that 
there are just so many false stones with 
with self-driving um where you think you 
think you've got the problem 
have a handle on the problem and then it 
nope uh it turns out uh you just hit a 
ceiling um and and uh 
uh 
because what happened if you if you were 
to plot the progress 
the progress looks like a log curve so 
it's like yeah 
a series of log curves so 
uh most people don't like cookies i 
suppose but it shows the show 
it goes it goes up sort of a you know 
sort of a fairly straight way and then 
it starts tailing off right and and and 
you start there's a kind of ocean 
getting diminishing returns you know in 
retrospect they seem obvious but uh in 
in order to solve uh full self-driving 
uh properly you actually just you have 
to solve real-world ai 
um you you you know because you said 
what are the road networks designed to 
to work with they're designed to work 
with a biological neural net our brains 
and with uh vision our eyes 
and so in order to make it work 
with computers you basically need 
to solve real world ai 
and vision 
because because we we need 
we need cameras 
and silicon neural nets 
uh in order to have to have 
self-driving work for a system that was 
designed for eyes and biological neural 
nets 
it you know when you i guess when you 
put it that way it's like quite obvious 
that the only way to solve full 
self-driving is to solve real-world 
ai and sophisticated vision what do you 
feel about the current architecture do 
you think you have an architecture now 
where where there is 
a chance for the logarithmic curve not 
to tail off any anytime 
soon 
well i mean 
admittedly these these uh may be an 
infamous uh last words but i i actually 
am confident that we will solve it this 
year 
uh that we will exceed uh 
you're like what the probability 
of an accident at what point should you 
exceed that of the average person right 
um i think we will exceed that this year 
we could be here 
talking again in a year it's like well 
yeah another year went by and it didn't 
happen but i think this i think this is 
the year is there an element that you 
actually deliberately 
make aggressive prediction timelines to 
drive people to be ambitious and without 
that nothing gets done 
so it's it feels like at some point in 
the last year 
seeing the progress on 
understanding you that you're that the 
ai the tesla ai understanding the world 
around it led to a kind of an aha moment 
in tesla because you really surprised 
people recently when you said 
probably the most important product 
development going on at tesla this year 
is this robot optimus yes 
is it something that happened in the 
development of fourself driving that 
gave you the confidence to say you know 
what we could do something special here 
yeah exactly so you know it took me a 
while to sort of realize that that in 
order to solve self-driving you really 
needed to solve real-world ai um 
at the point of which you solve 
real-world ai for a car which is really 
a robot on four wheels uh you can then 
generalize that to a robot on legs as 
well 
the thing that the things that are 
currently missing are uh 
enough intelligence enough to tell 
intelligence for the robot to navigate 
the real world and do useful things 
without being explicitly instructed it 
is so so the missing things are 
basically real world uh intelligence and 
uh scaling up manufacturing um those are 
two things that tesla is very good at 
and 
uh so then we basically just need to 
design the the uh specialized actuators 
and sensors that are needed for a 
humanoid robot 
people have no idea this is going to be 
bigger than the car 
um but so talk about i mean i think the 
first applications you you've mentioned 
are probably going to be manufacturing 
but eventually the vision is to to have 
these available for people at home 
correct if you had a robot that really 
understood the 3d architecture of your 
house and 
knew where every object in that house 
was or was supposed to be and could 
recognize all those objects i mean that 
that's kind of amazing isn't that like 
like that the kind of thing that you 
could ask a robot to do 
would be what like tidy up yeah um 
absolutely 
or make make dinner i guess mow the lawn 
take take a cup of tea to grandma and 
show her family pictures and 
exactly take care of my grandmother and 
make sure yeah exactly and it could 
recognize obviously recognize everyone 
in the home yeah could play catch with 
your kids yes i mean obviously we need 
to be careful this doesn't uh become a 
dystopian situation 
um like i think one of the things that's 
going to be important is to have a 
localized rom chip on the 
robot that cannot be updated over the 
air uh where if you for example were to 
say stop stop stop that would if anyone 
said that then the robot would stop you 
know type of thing 
and that's not updatable remotely um i 
think it's going to be important to have 
safety features like that 
yeah that that sounds wise and i do 
think there should be a regular free 
agency for ai i've said this for many 
years i don't love being regulated but i 
you know i think this is an important 
thing for public safety do you think 
there will be basically like in say 2050 
or whatever that like a 
a robot in most homes is what they will 
be and people will 
probably count 
you'll have your own butler basically 
yeah you'll have your sort of buddy 
robot 
probably yeah i mean how much of a buddy 
do like do you do 
how many applications you thought is 
there you know can you have a romantic 
partner 
lot of a sex 
inevitable 
i mean i did promise the internet that i 
would make cat girls we'll have we could 
make a robot cackle 
how are you because yeah 
you know 
so 
yeah i i guess uh it'll be what whatever 
people want really you know so what sort 
of timeline should we be 
thinking about of the first the first 
models that are actually made and 
sold 
you know the the first units that that 
we tend to make are 
um 
for jobs that are dangerous boring 
repetitive and things that people don't 
want to do and you know i think we'll 
have like an interesting prototype uh 
sometime this year we might have 
something useful next year but i think 
quite likely within at least two years 
and then we'll see rapid growth year 
over year of the usefulness of the 
humanoid robots um and decrease in cost 
and scaling out production 
help me on the economics of this so what 
what do you picture the cost of one of 
these being well i think the cost is 
actually not going to be uh crazy high 
um 
like less than a car yeah but but think 
about the economics of this if you can 
replace a 
thirty thousand dollar forty thousand 
dollar a year worker 
which you have to pay every year 
with a one-time payment of twenty five 
thousand dollars for a robot that can 
work longer hours 
doesn't go on vacation i mean that could 
it could be a pretty rapid replacement 
of certain types of jobs how worried 
should the world be about that 
i wouldn't worry about the the sort of 
putting people out of a job thing um i 
think 
we're actually going to have and already 
do have a massive shortage of labor so i 
i i think we'll we will have um 
uh 
not not people out of work but actually 
still a shortage labor even in the 
future uh but 
this really will be a world of abundance 
any goods and services 
uh will be available to anyone who wants 
them that it'll be so cheap to have 
goods and services it'll be ridiculous 
so 
that is part of 
an epic 80 minute interview 
which we are releasing to people 
members of ted 2022 right after this 
conference um you should be able to 
look at it on the ted live 
website 
um there's public interest in it we're 
putting that out to the world on sunday 
afternoon i think sunday evening but uh 
but if you're into this kind of stuff um 
definitely a good thing to do over the 
weekend um 
now then 
hearing from elon live there's there's 
huge public interest in that we have 
opened up this segment to live stream 
and so 
we're joined right now by i think quite 
a few people around the world um welcome 
to vancouver welcome to ted 22 you're 
joining us on the last day of our 
conference here in a packed 
theater 
and 
we've been hearing all week from 
people with dreams about what the next 
era 
of humanity is going to be 
and now arguably 
the biggest visionary of them all elon 
musk 
[Music] 
hey elon welcome 
so elon um a few hours ago 
you 
made 
an offer to buy twitter 
why 
[Laughter] 
how'd you know 
little bird 
tweeted in my ear or something i don't 
know 
by the way have you seen the movie ted 
about the bear 
i i i have i have a movie 
so um 
yeah yeah so 
was there a question 
why why make that offer oh so 
um 
well i think it's very important for 
uh there to be 
an inclusive arena for 
free speech 
where 
all yeah so uh yeah 
um 
twitter has become kind of the de facto 
town square um so 
uh 
it's just really important that people 
have the both the uh the reality and the 
perception 
uh that they're able to speak freely 
within the bounds of the law um 
and 
you know so one of the things that i 
believe twitter should do is open source 
the algorithm 
um and make any changes 
uh to people's tweets you know if 
they're emphasized or de-emphasized uh 
that action should be 
made apparent so you anyone can see that 
action has been taken 
so there's there's no sort of behind the 
scenes 
manipulation either algorithmically or 
manually um 
but 
last week when we spoke elon um i asked 
you whether you were thinking of taking 
over you said no way said i i do not 
want to own twitter it is a recipe for 
misery everyone will blame me for 
everything what on earth changed no i 
think i think everyone will still blame 
me for everything 
yeah if something if if i acquire 
twitter and something goes wrong it's my 
fault 100 
i i think there will be quite a few 
arrows uh yes um it will it will be 
miserable but you still want to do it 
why i mean i hope it's not too miserable 
uh but 
um 
i i just think it's important to the fun 
like 
uh 
it's important to the function of 
democracy 
it's important to the function of 
uh the united states uh as a free 
country and many other countries and to 
help 
actually to help 
freedom in the world 
more broadly than the u.s 
and so 
i think it's uh 
it's a 
you know i think this there's the risk 
civilizational risk 
uh is decreased if twitter 
the more we can increase the trust of 
twitter as a public platform and so 
i do think this will be somewhat painful 
and i'm not sure that i will actually be 
able to to acquire it 
and i should also say 
the intent is is to 
retain as many shareholders as is 
allowed by the law in a private company 
which i think is around 
2000 or so so we'll it's not like it 
it's definitely not not from the 
standpoint of letting me figure out how 
to monopolize or maximize my ownership 
of twitter 
but we'll try to bring along as many 
shoulders as we right as we're allowed 
to you don't necessarily want to pay out 
40 or whatever it is billion dollars in 
cash you you'd like them to come come 
with you in in 
i mean 
i mean i could technically afford it um 
what i'm saying is this this is 
this is uh this is not a 
way to sort of make money 
you know i think this is it's just that 
i think this is um this could 
my 
strong intuitive sense is that uh having 
a public platform that is maximally 
trusted 
um and and and 
and broadly inclusive 
um is extremely important to the future 
of civilization but you've described 
yourself i don't care about the 
economics at all 
okay that's that's core to hear you this 
is not about the economics it's for the 
the moral good that you think will 
achieve you you've described yourself 
elon as a free speech absolutist 
but 
does that mean that there's literally 
nothing that people can't say and it's 
okay 
well i i i think uh 
obviously uh twitter or any forum is 
bound by the laws of the country that it 
operates in um 
so 
obviously there are some limitations on 
free speech uh in in the us and and of 
course uh 
twitter would have to abide by those uh 
right rules so so so you can't incite 
people to violence like that that the 
like a direct incitement to violence you 
know you can't do the equivalent of 
crying fire in a in a movie theater for 
example no that would be a crime yeah 
right 
it should be a crime but here's here's 
the challenge is is that it's it's such 
a nuanced difference between different 
things so 
there's 
there's excitement to violence yeah 
that's a no if it's illegal um there's 
hate speech which some forms of hate 
speech are fine you know i hate spinach 
um 
i mean if it's a sauteed in a 
you know cream sauce that would be quite 
nice 
but so so 
but the problem is so so so let's say 
someone says okay here's one tweet i 
hate politician x yeah next tweet is i 
wish polite politician x wasn't alive 
as we some of us have said about putin 
right now for example so that's 
legitimate speech 
another tweet is i wish politician x 
wasn't alive with a picture of their 
head with a gun sight over it 
or that plus their address i mean at 
some point 
someone has to make a decision as to 
which of those is not okay can an 
algorithm 
do that well surely you need human 
judgment at some point 
no i think 
the like i said 
in my view 
uh twitter should um 
match the laws of the of the country of 
and and and really you know 
that there's an obligation to to do that 
um 
but going beyond going beyond that um 
and having it be 
unclear who's making what changes to who 
to where 
uh having tweets sort of mysteriously be 
promoted and demoted 
with no insight into what's going on uh 
having a black box algorithm uh promote 
some things and other not not other 
things i think this can be quite 
dangerous 
so so so the idea of opening the 
algorithm is a huge deal and i think 
many people would would welcome that of 
understanding exactly how it's making 
the decision and critique it and 
critique like i want to improve what 
wondering is like like i think like the 
code should be on github you know so 
then uh and so people can look through 
it and say like i see a problem here i 
don't i don't agree with this 
um 
they can highlight issues right um 
suggest changes in the same way that you 
sort of update linux or or signal or 
something like that you know but as i 
understand it like at some point right 
now 
what the algorithm would do is it would 
look at for example how many people have 
flagged a tweet as obnoxious 
and then 
at some point a human has to look at it 
and make make a decision as to does this 
cross the line or not that the algorithm 
itself can't i don't think yet um tell 
the difference between 
legal and okay and and definitely 
obnoxious and so the question is which 
humans you know make make that 
core i mean do you have do you have a 
picture of that right now twitter 
and facebook and others you know they've 
hired thousands of people to try to help 
make wise decisions and the trouble is 
that no one can agree on on what is wise 
how do you solve that 
well i i i think we would want to er on 
this if if in doubt 
uh 
let let the speech that let it exist uh 
it would have you know if it's a 
you know a 
a gray area i would say let let the 
tweet exist 
um 
but 
obviously you know in a case where 
there's perhaps a lot of controversy uh 
that you would not want to necessarily 
promote that tweet if uh you know so the 
i'm not i'm not saying this is that i 
have all the answers here um 
but 
i i do think that we want to be just 
very reluctant to delete things 
and and have um 
just just be very cautious with with 
with permanent bands uh you know 
timeouts i think are better or uh than 
sort of permanent bands 
and um 
but just just in general like i said 
uh how how it won't be perfect but i 
think we wanted to really uh have 
like so the possession and reality that 
speech is as 
free as reasonably possible 
and a good sign as to whether there's 
free speech is 
is 
is someone you 
don't like allowed to say something you 
don't like 
and if that is the case then we have 
free speech and it's it's damn annoying 
when someone you don't like says 
something you don't like 
that is a sign of a healthy functioning 
uh 
free speech situation 
so 
i think many people would agree with 
that and look at the reaction online 
many people are excited by 
you coming in and the changes you're 
proposing some others are absolutely 
horrified here's how they would see it 
they would say wait a sec we agree that 
that twitter is an incredibly important 
town square it is a it is you know where 
the world exchanges opinion about life 
and death matters 
how on earth could it be owned by the 
world's richest person that can't be 
right 
so how how do you i mean what's the 
response there is there any way that you 
can 
distance yourself from the actual 
decision-making that matters on content 
at 
in some very clear way that is 
convincing to people 
well like i said i think the 
it's it's very important that like the 
the algorithm be open sourced and that 
any manual uh adjustments be 
uh identified like so if this tweet if 
somebody did something to a tweet it's 
there's information attached to it that 
this that action was taken and i i i i 
won't personally be uh you know in their 
editing tweets 
um 
but you'll know if something was done to 
promote demote or otherwise affect uh a 
tweet um 
you know 
as for 
media sort of ownership i mean you've 
got you know um mark zuckerberg owning 
facebook and 
instagram and whatsapp um 
and with a share ownership structure 
that will 
have 
mark zuckerberg the 14th still 
controlling those 
uh entities 
so 
literally um 
what's that need we won't have that on 
twitter 
if if you commit to opening up the 
algorithm that that definitely gives 
some level of confidence um talk about 
talk about some of the other changes 
that you've proposed so you 
at the edit button that's that's 
definitely coming if you if you have 
your way yeah yeah 
and how do you i mean i i think 
i mean 
one 
frankly 
um 
the 
top priority i have i would have is is 
eliminating the the spammings and scam 
bots 
and the bot armies that are on twitter 
um 
you know i think i think these these fun 
influence 
that 
they're not they're they're they they 
make the product much worse 
um if i see if you know 
if i had a dogecoin for every crypto 
scam i saw 
[Laughter] 
more you know 100 billion dollars 
do you regret sparking the sort of storm 
of excitement overdose and you know 
where it's gone or 
i mean i think deutsche is fun and you 
know i've always said don't bet the form 
of dogecoin uh fyi 
yeah 
but i i think i think it's it's i like 
dogs and i like memes and uh it's got 
both of those 
and 
but just on the on the edit button how 
how do you get around the problem of so 
someone tweets elon rocks and it's 
tweeted by two million people um and um 
and then then after that they edit it so 
i'm elon sucks and um and then all those 
retweets 
they're all embarrassed and how how do 
you avoid that type of 
changing of meaning so that retweeters 
are exploited 
well i think uh you know you'd only have 
the edit capability for a short period 
of time and probably the thing to do at 
upon the edit would be to zero out 
all retweets and favorites 
okay 
i'm open to ideas though you know 
so in one way the um algorithm works 
kind of well for you right now i just i 
wanted to show you this this is so 
this is a typical tweet of of mine kind 
of lame and wordy and whatever and look 
at and the amazing response it gets is 
this oh my god 
97 likes 
um and then i tried another one um 
and uh 
29 000 likes so the algorithm at least 
seems to be at the moment you know if 
elon musk expanded the world immediately 
um not bad right 
yeah i guess so i mean that was 
cool 
i mean you but but you've 
so help us understand how it is you've 
built this incredible 
um following on twitter yourself when 
i mean some of the people who love you 
the most look at some of what you tweet 
and they they 
they think it's somewhere between um 
embarrassing and crazy some of it's 
amazing i mean 
[Laughter] 
is that actually why it's worked or why 
why has it worked 
i mean i don't know i mean i i'm 
you know tweeting more or less stream of 
consciousness you know it's not like let 
me think about some grand plan about my 
twitter or whatever you know i'm like 
literally on the toilet or something i'm 
like oh this is funny and then tweet 
that out you know 
that's 
that's like most of them 
[Laughter] 
you know over sharing 
but um but you are obsessed with getting 
the most out of every minute of your day 
and so why not you know 
um 
so 
i don't know i just like try to tweet 
out like things that are interesting or 
funny or 
you know and then people seem to 
like it 
so if if you are unsuccessful actually 
before i ask that let me ask this if i 
don't 
yeah so how can i say 
is uh funding secured 
[Music] 
i i have sufficient uh assets to 
complete the 
uh 
it's not a forward-looking statement 
blah blah but 
i have to i mean i can do it if possible 
right um 
so um 
and um 
i mean i should say actually even in the 
in 
originally 
the 
uh with with tesla back in the day 
funding was actually secured 
i want to be clear about that 
um in fact this may be a good 
opportunity to to to clarify that um 
if funding was indeed secured um and uh 
i should say like why why do i do not 
have respect for the sec in that 
situation and i don't mean to 
blame everyone at the sec but certainly 
the san francisco office 
um it's because the sec 
knew that funding was secured 
but they pursued the 
an active public investigation 
nonetheless at the time tesla was in a 
precarious financial situation 
and i was told by the banks that if i 
did not agree to settle with the sec 
that they would the banks would cease 
providing working capital and tesla 
would go bankrupt immediately 
so that's like having 
a gun to your child's head 
so i was forced to concede to the sec 
unlawfully 
those bastards 
and and and now that they they say 
it makes it look like i lied when i did 
not in fact lie i was i was forced to 
admit that i lied for to save tesla's 
life and that's the only reason 
given what's actually happened 
given what's actually happened to tesla 
since then though aren't you glad that 
you didn't take it private 
yeah i mean 
it's difficult to put yourself in the 
position at the time tesla was under the 
most relentless short seller attack in 
the history of the stock market 
uh there's something called short and 
distort 
um where the barrage of negativity that 
tesla was experiencing from short sales 
wall street was beyond or belief tesla 
was the most shorted stock in the 
history of stock markets 
this is saying something 
so 
you know this was affecting our ability 
to hire people it was affecting our 
ability to sell cars 
it was 
uh 
they were 
yeah it was terrible um 
yeah they wanted tesla to die so bad 
they could taste it 
well most of them have paid the price 
yes 
where are they now 
um 
so 
so that was a really strong statement i 
mean obviously a lot of people 
who who support you i thought would say 
you have so much to 
offer the world on the upside on the 
vision side don't don't waste your time 
getting getting distracted by these 
these battles that bring out negativity 
and and and make people feel that you're 
being defensive or like people don't 
like fights especially with with 
powerful government authorities they'd 
rather they'd rather buy into your to a 
dream do do you like aren't you 
encouraged by people just just to edit 
that 
in that 
you know temptation out and uh 
go with the bigger story 
um well i mean i i would say like you 
know i'm sort of a mixed bag you know i 
mean well you're a fighter and you you 
don't you don't you don't you don't 
you don't like to lose and and you you 
you are determined that you don't 
basically i i mean you are sure i don't 
like to lose i'm not sure many people do 
um 
but the truth matters to me a lot really 
like 
sort of pathologically it matters to me 
okay so so you don't like to lose if in 
this case you are not successful in you 
know the board 
does not accept your offer you've said 
you won't go higher is there a plan b 
there is 
i i think we i think we would like to 
hear a little bit about plan b 
for it for another time i think 
another time yeah all right 
[Applause] 
i that that's a nice tease all right so 
um 
i i would love 
to 
try to understand this brain of yours 
more ilan i i if with your permission 
i'd like to just play this this is the 
oh actually before we do that 
um here was one of the of the thousands 
of questions that people asked i thought 
this was actually quite a good one um if 
you could go back in time and change one 
decision you made along the way 
do your own edit button 
which one would it be and why 
do you mean like a career decision or 
something 
just any decision over the last 
few years like your decision to invest 
in twitter in the first place or your 
anything um i mean the 
the worst business decision i ever made 
was 
um 
not starting tesla with just jb straval 
by far the worst decision i've ever made 
is not just starting tesla with jb 
that that that's the number one by far 
all right so jb strabo was was the 
visionary co-founder who who who was 
obsessed with and knew so much about 
batteries and your your decision to go 
with tesla the company as it was meant 
that you got locked into what you 
concluded it was a weird architecture 
now this this 
there's a lot of confusion tesla 
tesla did not exist in any 
tesla was a shell company with no 
employees uh no intellectual property 
when i invested but the 
a false narrative has been created by um 
one of the other co-founders uh martin 
everhard and i don't want to get into 
the nastiness here but uh 
i didn't invest in an existing company 
we created a company yeah and 
ultimately the creation that company uh 
was was done by 
uh jv and me um and 
unfortunately there's a someone else and 
another co-founder who has made it his 
life's mission 
uh to make it sound like he he created 
the company which is false wasn't there 
another issue 
right at the heart of the development of 
the tesla model 3 where tesla almost 
went bankrupt and i i think you have 
said that part of the reason for that 
was that you overestimated the extent to 
which it was possible at that time to 
automate a a factory a huge amount was 
spent 
kind of over automating and it didn't 
work 
and it nearly took the company down is 
that fair 
uh i mean 
first of all it's important to 
understand like what what has tesla 
actually accomplished that is that is 
most noteworthy um it is not the 
creation of 
an electric vehicle or creating 
electrical vehicle prototype or 
low volume production 
of a 
of a car that they've been 
uh hundreds of cars startups over the 
years hundreds and uh in fact at one 
point um bloomberg counted up the number 
of electric vehicle startups and they i 
think they got to almost 500. yeah so 
the hard part is not creating a 
prototype or going into limited 
production 
the the the absolutely difficult thing 
which has not been accomplished by an 
american car company in 100 years is 
reaching volume production without going 
bankrupt 
is the actual hard thing 
um the last company american company to 
reach volume production without going 
bankrupt was chrysler in the 20s right 
and and and it nearly happened to tesla 
yes it but it's not like oh geez i guess 
if we just done more manual stuff things 
would have been fine 
of course not uh that is definitely not 
the case uh 
so 
we basically messed up 
almost every aspect of the model 3 
production line 
from 
from cells to packs to 
driving voters 
motors 
body line the paint shop 
uh 
final assembly 
um 
everything everything was messed up 
um and i lived in that fa i lived in the 
fremont and and nevada factories 
for three years 
fixing the that production line running 
around like a maniac 
through every part of that factory 
living with the team 
i slept on the floor 
so that the 
the team who was going through 
a hard time 
could see me on the floor 
uh 
that they knew that i was not in some 
ivory tower 
whatever pain they experienced i was i 
had it more and some people who knew you 
well 
actually thought you were making a 
terrible mistake that you were driving 
yourself you were 
you were driving yourself to the edge of 
sanity almost and yeah and 
and that you were in danger of making 
bad 
choices and in fact i heard you say last 
week elon that that you because of 
tesla's huge value now and and you know 
the the significance of every minute 
that you spend that you are in danger of 
sort of 
obsessing over spending all this time to 
the point of to the edge of 
sanity 
um 
that doesn't that doesn't sound super 
wise isn't that like your your your time 
your your completely sane centered 
rested time and decision making 
is more powerful and compelling than 
that sort of i can barely 
hold my eyes open so surely it should be 
an absolute strategic priority to look 
after yourself 
i mean there wasn't any other way to 
make it work 
there were three years of hell 
17 8 2017 18 and 19 
with three years 
this longest period of excruciating pain 
in my life 
uh 
there wasn't any other way and we barely 
made it and we're on the ragged edge of 
bankruptcy the entire time 
so 
so when you felt like i want 
pain 
i don't like it 
um 
those were three or three so so much 
pain 
but it had to be done or tesla would be 
dead when you looked around the 
gigafactory that we saw images of 
earlier 
um last week and just see where the 
companies come i mean do you feel that 
that this this challenge of 
figuring out the the new way of 
manufacturing um that you that 
you actually have an edge now that it's 
different that you've figured out how to 
do this and 
and um from 
those three years 
what won't be repeated you've actually 
figured out a new way of manufacturing 
at this point i think i know 
more about manufacturing than anyone 
currently alive on earth 
between that 
yeah 
i'll tell you i can tell you how every 
damn part part in that car is made 
which basically if you just live on the 
factory live in the factory for three 
years and 
that was nice that was a poignant note 
or something 
someone wants to compose a symphony to 
that uh expression of confidence uh 
something like that i have no idea what 
that is 
anyway yeah 
every aspect of a car six weeks to 
sunday i know 
i mean you you you 
talk about scale right now you're in the 
middle of writing your new master plan 
and you've said that scale is at the 
heart of it 
why does scale matter why are you 
obsessed with that what are you thinking 
yeah well see 
in order in order to accelerate the 
advent of sustainable energy 
uh there must be scale 
because we've got a transition um a vast 
economy that is currently uh overly 
dependent on fossil fuels to a 
sustainable energy economy one where the 
energy is uh 
yeah i mean we got to do it 
so so the energy's got to be sustainably 
generated with wind solar uh hydro 
geothermal i i'm a believer in nuclear 
as uh as well i think ever talk about 
and 
uh and then you you 
since solar and wind is intermittent you 
have to have stationary storage 
batteries and and then we're going to 
transition all transport um 
to to electric uh 
if we do those things we have a 
sustainable energy future the faster we 
do those things the less risk we 
the less risk we 
put to the environment 
uh so sooner is better uh and and so 
scale is very important um 
you know it's not about it's not about 
press releases it's about tonnage what 
was the tonnage of 
of batteries produced 
and obviously done in a sustainable way 
and and our estimate is that 
approximately 300 terawatt hours of 
battery storage is needed to transition 
uh transport uh 
electricity and and heating and cooling 
uh to a fully electric situation others 
may 
there's there may be some 
different estimates out out there but uh 
our estimate is 300 terawatt hours yeah 
so we dug into this a lot in the 
interview that we recorded last week and 
so people can go in and hear that more 
but i mean the context is that is i 
think about a thousand times the current 
install battery capacity i mean the 
scale up needed is 
breathtaking basically yeah and and and 
um 
yeah so so your vision is to commit 
tesla to try to deliver on a meaningful 
percentage of what is needed yeah and 
what and call on others to do the rest 
that this is what this is a task for 
humanity to massively scale up our 
response to change change the energy 
grade 
yes it it's 
it's like basically how fast can we can 
we scale um and encourage others to 
scale 
to get to that 300 terawatt hour 
installed uh base of batteries right 
and then of course uh there'll be a 
tremendous need to recycle those 
batteries which is i and it makes sense 
to recycle them because the raw 
materials are like high grade ore um so 
people shouldn't think well they'd be 
this big pile of batteries now they're 
going to get recycled because the 
even a dead battery pack is worth about 
a thousand dollars so 
um but but this is what's needed for a 
sustainable energy future so we're going 
to try to take the set of actions that 
accelerate the day of and bring the day 
of a sustainable energy future sooner 
okay 
there's going to be a huge interest in 
your master plan when you when you 
publish that um meanwhile i just i would 
love to 
understand more 
what goes on in this brain of yours 
because it is it is a pretty unique one 
i want to play with your permission this 
very funny opening from snl saturday 
night live can we have the volume there 
actually please sorry 
it's an honor to be hosting saturday 
night live i mean that 
sometimes after i say something i have 
to say i mean that 
[Music] 
so people really know that i mean 
that's because i don't always have a lot 
of 
international variation in how i speak 
which i'm told makes for great comedy 
i'm actually making history tonight as 
the first person 
with asperger's to host snl 
[Applause] 
and i think you followed that up with at 
least the first person to admit it the 
first person to admit it 
but i mean 
so this was a great thing to say 
but i i would love to 
understand 
whether you know how you think of of 
asperger's like whether you can give us 
any sense of even you as a boy how what 
what the experience 
was or as you now 
understand with the benefit of hindsight 
can you talk about that a bit 
well i think i think everyone's 
experience is going to be somewhat 
different 
but i guess for me the 
social cues were not uh intuitive so 
i was just very bookish and i didn't 
understand 
this i guess 
others could 
sort of intuitively understand uh 
what watches meant by something 
i would just tend to take things very 
literally as just like the words 
as spoken word exactly what they meant 
but but then that 
didn't turn out to be wrong 
you can't they do not they're not simply 
saying exactly what they mean 
there's all sorts of other things that 
are meant it took me a while to figure 
that out um 
so 
i was you know bullied quite a lot 
um 
so 
i didn't i did not have a sort of happy 
childhood to be frank was quite quite 
rough um 
and um 
but i read a lot of books i read lots 
and lots of books 
and so that you know 
sort of 
gradually i sort of understood more from 
the books that i was reading and watched 
a lot of movies 
and 
you know just 
but it took it took me it took me a 
while to understand things that most 
people 
intuitively understand 
so i've wondered whether it's possible 
that that was in a strange way an 
incredible gift to you and and 
indirectly to many other people 
in as much as 
brains you know are plastic and they 
they they go where the action is and if 
in for some reason the external world 
and social cues which so many people 
spend so much time and energy and mental 
energy obsessing over if that is partly 
cut off 
isn't it possible that that is partly 
what gave you 
the ability to 
understand inwardly 
the world at a much deeper level than 
than most people do 
i suppose that's certainly possible um 
i think this may be some value also from 
a technology standpoint because 
i found it uh rewarding to spend all 
night programming computers 
um just by myself and 
i think most people 
most people don't enjoy typing strange 
symbols into a computer by themselves 
all night 
they think that's 
not fun but i thought it was i really 
liked it um so so i just programmed all 
night by myself and 
um i found that to be quite enjoyable 
um but but i think that is not uh normal 
[Music] 
so i mean it does you know i've thought 
a lot about 
it's a riddle to a lot of people of of 
how you've done this how you've 
repeatedly innovated in these different 
industries and it it does you know every 
entrepreneur sees possibility in the 
future and then acts to make that real 
it it feels to me like you see 
possibility just more broadly than 
almost anyone and can connect with so 
you see scientific possibility based on 
a deep understanding of physics and 
knowing what the fundamental equations 
are 
what the technologies are that are based 
on that science and where they could go 
you see technological possibility and 
then really unusually you combine that 
with 
economic possibility of like what it 
actually would cost is there a system 
you can imagine where you could 
affordably make that thing and that that 
sometimes you then get conviction that 
there is an opportunity here put those 
pieces together and you could do 
something 
amazing 
yeah i think one aspect of whatever 
condition i had um was i was just 
absolutely obsessed with truth 
just obsessed with truth 
and and so the obsession with truth is 
why i studied physics 
because physics attempts to understand 
the 
the truth the truth of the universe 
physics just it's just what are the 
provable truths of the universe 
um 
and and true and truths that have 
predictive power 
um 
so for me physics was sort of a very 
natural thing to study 
nobody made me study it it was 
intrinsically interesting 
to understand the nature of the universe 
and then computer science 
or information theory 
also to just i understand uh logic and 
and 
uh 
you know there's an also there's an 
argument that 
you know that you the that information 
theory is actually operating 
at a more fundamental level more 
fundamental level than than even physics 
um 
so 
uh just yeah um 
the physics and information theory uh 
were really interesting to me so when 
you say truth i mean it's it's not 
like some people 
so it's what you're talking about is the 
truth of the universe like the 
fundamental truths that drive the 
universe it's like a deep curiosity 
about what this universe is why we're 
here simulation why not you know we 
don't have time to go into that but i 
mean it's you're just deeply curious 
about 
what this is for what this is this whole 
thing yes i mean i think the why the why 
of things is very important 
um 
i i actually 
uh when i was a i don't know 
so young teens 
uh i i got quite depressed about the 
meaning of life 
um and i was trying to sort of 
understand the meaning of life looking 
at reading religious texts and and 
reading books on philosophy 
and i got into the german philosophers 
which is definitely not wise if you're a 
young teenager i have to say 
can be ripped out but dark 
so 
[Music] 
much better at as an adult i um and and 
then actually i ended up reading um the 
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy 
which is actually a book on philosophy 
just sort of disguised as a silly humor 
book but but actually the book it's 
actually a 
philosophy book 
and 
uh adams uh makes the point that 
it's actually the 
the question that is harder than the 
answer 
um you know this sort of makes a joke 
that the answer was 42. um that number 
does pop up a lot um 
and 420 is just 10 14 10 10 times 10 
times more significant than 42. okay 
you know there's um you can make a 
triangle with 42 or 42 degrees and two 
69s 
um 
so there's no such thing as a perfect 
triangle or is there 
but even more important than the answer 
is the questions that was the whole 
theme of that book i mean is that yeah 
basically how you see meaning then it's 
the pursuit of questions yeah so i have 
a sort of 
you know a proposal for a world view or 
a motivate a motivating philosophy which 
is to understand 
what questions to ask about the answer 
that is the universe and the to agree 
that we expand the scope and scale of 
consciousness 
uh 
biological and digital 
uh we will be better able to to uh ask 
these 
these questions to frame these questions 
and to understand 
why we're here how we got here what 
what the heck is going on 
and so that that is my driving 
philosophy is to expand the scope and 
scale of consciousness that we may 
better understand the nature of the 
universe 
elon one of the things that was most 
touching last week 
was uh was seeing you hang out with your 
kids um here's if i may 
um 
it looks vaguely like a ventriloquist 
dummy there 
[Laughter] 
i mean how do you know that's real 
um 
so that's x and and you know you're it 
was just a delight seeing seeing you 
hang out with him and 
what 
what what what's his future 
going to be i mean i don't mean him 
personally but the world he's going to 
grow up in 
what future do you believe he will grow 
up in 
well i mean a very digital future 
um 
a very a different world than i grew up 
in that's for sure 
um 
but i think we want to obviously do our 
absolute best to ensure that the future 
is good uh for everyone's children 
um and 
and that 
you know that the future is something 
that that you can look forward to and 
not feel sad about 
um 
you know you want to get up in the 
morning and be be excited about the 
future and we should fight for the 
things that make us excited about the 
future you know the future cannot it 
cannot just be that one 
miserable thing after another solving 
one sad problem after another there got 
to be things that get you excited like 
you're like you want to live 
these things are very important 
you should have more of it 
and it's not as if it's a done deal like 
it's all it's all to play for like the 
future may be 
horrible still there are scenarios where 
it is horrible but you you see a pathway 
to an exciting future both on earth and 
on mars and 
in our minds through artificial 
intelligence and so forth i mean in your 
in your heart of hearts do you really 
believe that you are helping deliver 
that exciting 
future 
for 
ex and for 
others 
i'm trying my hardest to do so 
i 
you know 
i love humanity and i think 
that 
we should fight for a good future for 
humanity and i think we should be 
optimistic about the future and fight to 
make that optimistic optimistic future 
happen 
[Music] 
i think that's that's the perfect place 
to close this thank you so much for 
spending time coming here and for the 
work that you're doing and good luck 
with finding a wise course through on 
twitter and everything else all right 
thank you 
hey guys 
[Music]
