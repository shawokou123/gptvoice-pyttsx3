so let's get down to business and we 
start with the exclusive interview that 
took place in San Francisco between Elon 
Musk and our technology correspondent 
James Clayton it is one of his first 
interviews since he bought Twitter for 
44 billion dollars he defended his 
decision to lay off a massive number of 
Staff saying that Twitter only had four 
months to live in less drastic measures 
were taken 
these are rough numbers a revenue 
dropped from four and a half billion to 
three 
um uh and um expenses went from four and 
a half to six creating a three billion 
dollar negative cash flow situation and 
Twitter having a billion dollars in the 
bank that's four months to live 
so unless drastic action was taken 
immediately this company is going to die 
let's talk about that drastic action 
because almost immediately 
um you sacked a lot of Twitter workers 
um yeah and and I I spoke to them it's 
very easy to speak to them uh when it 
happened and and the way they said 
pretty much everyone said is that it 
felt quite haphazard it was and it felt 
a little bit uncaring do you do you say 
uncare 
you know the issue is like uh the 
companies are going to go bankrupt or if 
we do not cut costs immediately 
um this is not a caring uncaring 
situation it's like if whole ship sinks 
so nobody's got a job 
right yeah but a lot of people just lost 
their jobs like that 
um and and they went they didn't even 
know they would they'd lost their jobs 
often they just they were just frozen 
out of their accounts what would you do 
well you might want to give someone some 
notice I mean you might it's by the way 
I'm not running Twitter but I know this 
is the criticism and this is what actual 
this is what staff members say a little 
bit of notice uh you know no I 
understand if you're four months to live 
120 days and 120 days you're dead 
so how so what do you want to do how 
much are you worth 
I don't know 
but I mean we're talking about around 
the 200 billion dollar Mark I mean it's 
not quite you're framing it in in a way 
that that you know it had had a few 
months to live you're quite a rich man 
um I saw a lot of Tesla stock to close 
this deal but I did not want to sell the 
Tesla stuff 
in what was quite a lengthy interview 
Elon Musk also said he is confident that 
the social media platform Twitter will 
become profitable again and advertisers 
will return let's have a listen to this 
in terms of advertising obviously the 
Twitter's not a private company anymore 
so we don't really know how it's how 
it's all going have all the advertisers 
come back 
uh not all but most 
and you can see it for yourself on 
Twitter even in the for you feed right I 
mean no sorry in the following don't use 
for you because it sucks rightly 
[Laughter] 
um 
um that's not what I said okay well why 
don't you use for you what's wrong with 
it 
um 
how is it going is is twittering profit 
now 
no Twitter is uh uh rough I'd say we're 
roughly break even at this point 
and I think you've said before you you 
see a you see a world where you could be 
in profit 
is there a timeline on that do you think 
I mean 
depending on how things go if current 
trends continue I think we could be 
profitable or I mean 
to be more precise we could be cash flow 
positive uh this quarter if things keep 
going well 
this quarter as soon as that uh possibly 
yeah wow 
um and do you have a message for the 
advertising I mean can you say which 
advertisers haven't come back 
um 
I think I think almost all of them have 
either come back or said they're going 
to come back there are very few 
exceptions can you say any of the 
exceptions 
I actually don't know of anyone who said 
definitively they're not coming back 
they're all sort of training towards 
coming back but there are some that just 
happened in the water's warm it's great 
that's your message to the to the 
advertisers they haven't come back yeah 
I mean look uh you know if if if Disney 
feels comfortable 
um advertising you know children's 
movies and apple feels comfortable 
advertising iPhones those are good 
indicators that Twitter is a good place 
to advertise 
um 
I want to talk about 
if you have any regret regrets and and 
you know I think you were Buddha Dave 
Chappelle concert I think your own 
lawyer said a little a little well 
some say a little some say a bit more 
um I think our own lawyer said you 
couldn't get a fair trial in San 
Francisco because there are lots of 
people that don't necessarily like you 
here yeah but you know I didn't say it I 
was wrong he was wrong I guess the uh 
because I was wedded uh by the San 
Francisco jury unanimously 
so 
but I guess but look do you have any 
regrets about buying Twitter 
um I think it was something that needed 
to be done 
um 
difficult you know I'd say that like the 
the pain level of Twitter has been 
extremely high 
um this hasn't been some sort of party 
um so uh it's been really quite a 
stressful situation uh you know for the 
last several months not not an easy one 
but apart from the pay I mean so it's 
been quite painful um but I think uh at 
the end of the day it should have been 
done I think tonight were there many 
mistakes made along the way of course 
you know 
um and uh 
but you know all swell it ends well and 
so I I feel like we're headed 
to a good place 
um you know where 
roughly break even I think we're 
trending towards being cash flow 
positive very soon like literally in a 
matter of of months the advertisers are 
returning 
um the I think the quality of 
recommended tweets has improved 
significantly and we've taken a lot of 
feedback from people that have looked at 
the open source recommendation algorithm 
and we've we've made a lot of 
improvements even even since that was 
made open source and we're going to keep 
doing that so overall I think the trend 
is very good so 
well let's unpack this further with our 
business reporter Gerald de Silva who 
joins us from our Bureau in Singapore 
Joe it was an extraordinary conversation 
you and I were both watching it live you 
in aubure and Singapore me in the studio 
here in London 
um he he he had so much to say about so 
many things but when it comes to Twitter 
itself and The Business 
he does sound confident he he is telling 
us all we'll be back in profit soon and 
advertisers will be back 
well we'll have to wait and see but Elon 
Musk did sound very upbeat in that 
interview he talked about daily usage 
being up and yes the company finally 
breaking even now that according to him 
advertisers are back he told James at 
one point how the situation was Bleak 
when he first took over accused the 
previous management of running it as a 
non-profit saying that the company had 
only in his own words a few months to 
live and he said that like other 
internet companies Twitter was facing a 
massive drop in Revenue all of that to 
justify of course those controversial 
Mass layoffs that we saw at Twitter 
earlier this year he admitted that the 
head count has gone from 8 000 to 1 500 
under his leadership the thing is many 
analysts are saying that that medicine 
might actually be the poison that's 
hurting Twitter many people in the 
content moderation team have been fired 
and advertisers fear that increase that 
increases the likelihood that their 
products will appear next to toxic 
content on the platform and we do know 
that major advertisers like Volkswagen 
like General Motors deed part did pause 
their relationship with Twitter earlier 
this year so we'll have to really wait 
and see whether indeed mask has reason 
to be optimistic about Twitter's future
