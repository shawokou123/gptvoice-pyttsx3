this is exclusive video of Elon giving a 
lecture at the home he used to own in 
Bel Air 
regular schools were doing a good enough 
job of preparing kids 
does anybody have any experience with 
first principles analysis do you know 
what it means 
he's a big proponent of teaching people 
to think based on first principles which 
is figuring out how things work by 
boiling them down to the basics for 
example it used to be that people 
thought a radical Improvement in 
rocketry was impossible space agencies 
and private companies tried to build 
reusable Rockets but failed the only one 
that kind of worked was NASA's Space 
Shuttle but the cost of refurbishing the 
boosters by fishing them out of the 
ocean was so great that it didn't make 
sense you look at what I was doing say 
well others did others didn't make it 
works therefore it doesn't work but that 
that has no basis in reality 
um okay both principles of foundational 
approach would be to say let's look at 
the physics and economics 
um of a rocket and say if we do if we do 
if we can analyze the physics 
of the rocket is it physically possible 
first principles thinking would break 
down the cost of the Rockets materials 
and figure out how to reassemble the 
materials to produce a more affordable 
rocket which is spacex's Mission at 
Astro School originally began out of 
spacex's Rocket Factory in Hawthorne 
California to teach elon's children and 
the kids of stem employees then it moved 
to his house for a couple of years the 
one that formerly belonged to Gene 
Wilder Elon was a guest lecturer the 
teacher who helped create the curriculum 
was Josh Dunn hey Josh hey Cindy Don 
taught one of elon's sons at a private 
school for gifted children in La the 
SpaceX CEO then approached him to start 
experimental school at his rocket 
Factory so if elon's directive was to 
make it great then okay well 
what is what does great look like it 
looked like a totally different 
experience than a typical School 
instead of classes in languages music or 
sports kids focused on critical thinking 
solving the types of problems SpaceX 
employees tackle like imagine how the 
grid fin could be redesigned he's 
referring to the fins that come down 
when the Falcon 9 lands could you 
imagine other designs and how would you 
even know if those designs would be more 
efficacious than the design that's 
currently being used the lesson of first 
principles is to not be bound by what's 
already been done you don't have to 
create grid fins of the same design size 
or material 
you can even go back to the drawing 
board completely and imagine something 
totally different that could direct a 
descending rocket can something other 
than grid fins be better for the 
successor to the Falcon 9 Starship 
there were also questions related to 
Tesla as students had exposure to 
Tesla's Design Studio within spacex's 
Hawthorne Factory for example like what 
could the supercharger Network look like 
in a country where it doesn't yet exist 
so what if you created the supercharger 
Network in Argentina there are many 
different ways to answer this question 
what Josh was looking for was the 
ability to reason centering 
superchargers around dense populations 
is a start and then the next question is 
like where do we go next and the way 
that they reason through that is really 
interesting because then they're seeing 
these like multiple Pathways that they 
could they could approach and one of the 
ways that you can help them is limit the 
number of superchargers that they could 
build so if you could only build you 
know 50 superchargers in the country of 
Argentina for that first year where were 
those 50b and this is high level 
thinking at a really young age it's a 
remarkable what kids are capable of when 
you give them opportunities where they 
have decisions to make Josh now runs 
synthesis an online program applying the 
same type of thinking at Elon school oh 
my gosh this is the best place 
we're going really fast 
students from around the world 
strategize in teams as a way to mirror 
collaboration in real life 
we'll start the first game in about five 
minutes although the students are as 
young as eight the problems they have to 
answer are difficult even for adults for 
example imagine that rocket travel is as 
normal as plane travel if you had to 
choose one future which would it be 
traveling to anywhere on Earth within an 
hour going sightseeing on the moon or 
three starting a city on Mars again 
there's no right or wrong answer but the 
idea is to start wondering like well 
which will come first and which one will 
change human life on here on on Earth 
most it's about figuring out what the 
future will look like and then building 
that future 
in the way that Tesla is looking to 
disrupt transportation and SpaceX the 
rocket industry Elon is reimagining the 
future of Education although his 
original private school is no longer 
running he's opened up another Ad Astra 
school at spacex's Star Base in Texas 
with a few dozen students well this type 
of education produce the next great 
entrepreneur 
there are many ways to learn that can be 
more effective than sitting in a 
classroom my sponsor brilliant is a 
website and app where you can improve 
your science math and computer science 
skills by learning interactively their 
puzzles are for people of all ages and 
experiences whether you're studying or 
if you're already working I use 
brilliant to improve my critical 
thinking skills by going through their 
logic courses 
brilliant has sponsored my videos since 
I started newsthink in 2020 and I've 
noticed my viewers especially love their 
computer science fundamentals course 
where you can wrap your mind around 
computational thinking and no coding is 
required their scientific thinking 
course is also really popular with my 
viewers you can explore the laws of 
physics and principles of engineering 
and learn the rules as you play if 
you're ever stuck you can view the 
explanation to understand where you went 
wrong brilliant is free for you to try 
out by going to the custom link in my
