<p>this is exclusive video of Elon giving a</p>
<p>lecture at the home he used to own in</p>
<p>Bel Air</p>
<p>regular schools were doing a good enough</p>
<p>job of preparing kids</p>
<p>does anybody have any experience with</p>
<p>first principles analysis do you know</p>
<p>what it means</p>
<p>he's a big proponent of teaching people</p>
<p>to think based on first principles which</p>
<p>is figuring out how things work by</p>
<p>boiling them down to the basics for</p>
<p>example it used to be that people</p>
<p>thought a radical Improvement in</p>
<p>rocketry was impossible space agencies</p>
<p>and private companies tried to build</p>
<p>reusable Rockets but failed the only one</p>
<p>that kind of worked was NASA's Space</p>
<p>Shuttle but the cost of refurbishing the</p>
<p>boosters by fishing them out of the</p>
<p>ocean was so great that it didn't make</p>
<p>sense you look at what I was doing say</p>
<p>well others did others didn't make it</p>
<p>works therefore it doesn't work but that</p>
<p>that has no basis in reality</p>
<p>um okay both principles of foundational</p>
<p>approach would be to say let's look at</p>
<p>the physics and economics</p>
<p>um of a rocket and say if we do if we do</p>
<p>if we can analyze the physics</p>
<p>of the rocket is it physically possible</p>
<p>first principles thinking would break</p>
<p>down the cost of the Rockets materials</p>
<p>and figure out how to reassemble the</p>
<p>materials to produce a more affordable</p>
<p>rocket which is spacex's Mission at</p>
<p>Astro School originally began out of</p>
<p>spacex's Rocket Factory in Hawthorne</p>
<p>California to teach elon's children and</p>
<p>the kids of stem employees then it moved</p>
<p>to his house for a couple of years the</p>
<p>one that formerly belonged to Gene</p>
<p>Wilder Elon was a guest lecturer the</p>
<p>teacher who helped create the curriculum</p>
<p>was Josh Dunn hey Josh hey Cindy Don</p>
<p>taught one of elon's sons at a private</p>
<p>school for gifted children in La the</p>
<p>SpaceX CEO then approached him to start</p>
<p>experimental school at his rocket</p>
<p>Factory so if elon's directive was to</p>
<p>make it great then okay well</p>
<p>what is what does great look like it</p>
<p>looked like a totally different</p>
<p>experience than a typical School</p>
<p>instead of classes in languages music or</p>
<p>sports kids focused on critical thinking</p>
<p>solving the types of problems SpaceX</p>
<p>employees tackle like imagine how the</p>
<p>grid fin could be redesigned he's</p>
<p>referring to the fins that come down</p>
<p>when the Falcon 9 lands could you</p>
<p>imagine other designs and how would you</p>
<p>even know if those designs would be more</p>
<p>efficacious than the design that's</p>
<p>currently being used the lesson of first</p>
<p>principles is to not be bound by what's</p>
<p>already been done you don't have to</p>
<p>create grid fins of the same design size</p>
<p>or material</p>
<p>you can even go back to the drawing</p>
<p>board completely and imagine something</p>
<p>totally different that could direct a</p>
<p>descending rocket can something other</p>
<p>than grid fins be better for the</p>
<p>successor to the Falcon 9 Starship</p>
<p>there were also questions related to</p>
<p>Tesla as students had exposure to</p>
<p>Tesla's Design Studio within spacex's</p>
<p>Hawthorne Factory for example like what</p>
<p>could the supercharger Network look like</p>
<p>in a country where it doesn't yet exist</p>
<p>so what if you created the supercharger</p>
<p>Network in Argentina there are many</p>
<p>different ways to answer this question</p>
<p>what Josh was looking for was the</p>
<p>ability to reason centering</p>
<p>superchargers around dense populations</p>
<p>is a start and then the next question is</p>
<p>like where do we go next and the way</p>
<p>that they reason through that is really</p>
<p>interesting because then they're seeing</p>
<p>these like multiple Pathways that they</p>
<p>could they could approach and one of the</p>
<p>ways that you can help them is limit the</p>
<p>number of superchargers that they could</p>
<p>build so if you could only build you</p>
<p>know 50 superchargers in the country of</p>
<p>Argentina for that first year where were</p>
<p>those 50b and this is high level</p>
<p>thinking at a really young age it's a</p>
<p>remarkable what kids are capable of when</p>
<p>you give them opportunities where they</p>
<p>have decisions to make Josh now runs</p>
<p>synthesis an online program applying the</p>
<p>same type of thinking at Elon school oh</p>
<p>my gosh this is the best place</p>
<p>we're going really fast</p>
<p>students from around the world</p>
<p>strategize in teams as a way to mirror</p>
<p>collaboration in real life</p>
<p>we'll start the first game in about five</p>
<p>minutes although the students are as</p>
<p>young as eight the problems they have to</p>
<p>answer are difficult even for adults for</p>
<p>example imagine that rocket travel is as</p>
<p>normal as plane travel if you had to</p>
<p>choose one future which would it be</p>
<p>traveling to anywhere on Earth within an</p>
<p>hour going sightseeing on the moon or</p>
<p>three starting a city on Mars again</p>
<p>there's no right or wrong answer but the</p>
<p>idea is to start wondering like well</p>
<p>which will come first and which one will</p>
<p>change human life on here on on Earth</p>
<p>most it's about figuring out what the</p>
<p>future will look like and then building</p>
<p>that future</p>
<p>in the way that Tesla is looking to</p>
<p>disrupt transportation and SpaceX the</p>
<p>rocket industry Elon is reimagining the</p>
<p>future of Education although his</p>
<p>original private school is no longer</p>
<p>running he's opened up another Ad Astra</p>
<p>school at spacex's Star Base in Texas</p>
<p>with a few dozen students well this type</p>
<p>of education produce the next great</p>
<p>entrepreneur</p>
<p>there are many ways to learn that can be</p>
<p>more effective than sitting in a</p>
<p>classroom my sponsor brilliant is a</p>
<p>website and app where you can improve</p>
<p>your science math and computer science</p>
<p>skills by learning interactively their</p>
<p>puzzles are for people of all ages and</p>
<p>experiences whether you're studying or</p>
<p>if you're already working I use</p>
<p>brilliant to improve my critical</p>
<p>thinking skills by going through their</p>
<p>logic courses</p>
<p>brilliant has sponsored my videos since</p>
<p>I started newsthink in 2020 and I've</p>
<p>noticed my viewers especially love their</p>
<p>computer science fundamentals course</p>
<p>where you can wrap your mind around</p>
<p>computational thinking and no coding is</p>
<p>required their scientific thinking</p>
<p>course is also really popular with my</p>
<p>viewers you can explore the laws of</p>
<p>physics and principles of engineering</p>
<p>and learn the rules as you play if</p>
<p>you're ever stuck you can view the</p>
<p>explanation to understand where you went</p>
